# ETechEcommerce Backend

## Development

1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` (for development)

## Deployment

Deploy the `server` folder to your backend hosting provider (e.g., Render, Railway, or your own server).

## Notes
- Make sure to set up environment variables as needed (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).
- The backend uses the `shared` folder for types and schema.
